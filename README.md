### Hi there, I'm saurav from India.

I love to work on web development tasks focussing mainly on backend tasks. Currently in the process of learning and applying on the go. My primary focus is based on MERN(MongoDb, Expressjs, Reactjs, Nodejs) stack. I also have experience on topics such as HTML, CSS, JS & Sass. Apart from web development, I also try to learn Data Structures and Algorithms which helps in boosting up my problem solving skills & helps me to understand languages in more depth. 


## Skills and Experience 

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* React
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB
* C/C++

I always look forward to learn more about Web Dev, DSA & work on more big complex projects.
